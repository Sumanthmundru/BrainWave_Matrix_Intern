# Brainwave_Matrix_Intern: Task 1 - Fake News Detection using Machine Learning
Welcome to the Task 1 repository for Fake News Detection using Machine Learning, part of the Brainwave Matrix Internship. This repository contains all the necessary code and resources for building a machine learning model to detect fake news articles.

## üìù Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore the application of machine learning techniques in identifying fake news articles. We aim to develop a model that can effectively distinguish between real and fake news.

### Key Components
* Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis and model training.
* Feature Engineering: Extracting meaningful features from text data to use in machine learning models.
* Model Selection and Training: Experimenting with different machine learning algorithms to find the best model for fake news detection.
* Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained models using various metrics.

### üìÇ Project Structure
The repository is structured as follows:
* data/: Contains the dataset (link provided below).
* notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for different stages of the project.
* src/: Source code for data processing, feature engineering, and model training.
* README.md: Project overview and instructions (this file).
